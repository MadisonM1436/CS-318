        <h2 id="history"> History of Timekeeping</h2>
        <p>Time has been measured for centuries using different methods. Early civilizations used **sundials**, hourglasses, and water clocks to track the passing of time.</p>
        <p>The invention of mechanical clocks in the 14th century revolutionized timekeeping, leading to modern digital and atomic clocks.</p>
       
     <h2 id="units"> Units of Time</h2>
     <ul>
        <li> 1 Second = The base unit of time.</li>
        <li>1 Minute = 60 seconds.</li>
        <li>1 Hour = 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>1 Day = 24 hours.</li>

        <li>Time slows down as you approach the speed of light (thanks, Einstein!).</li>
